Healthcare under pressure…

1. Changing Demographics, e.g.:
•   3.6m will be 85 or older in the UK by
2035 (1.4m now).
•   Healthcare systems will face significant
difficulties in meeting current
expectations of standards of care.



ONS - 2012


2. Rise in long term health conditions, e.g.
•   Antidepressants prescriptions up by 28% over three years.
•   25% of adults in England are obese (5% of NHS budget).
•   25% increase in diabetes diagnosis between
2006 and 2011.
•   6-10% of all hospital admissions could be
prevented if medication was taken correctly.
                       Ho me as a  final  fron tier  …                     




•  A large part of our lives, and increasingly so in
advanced age, is spent in the home, but very little is known about our activities and behaviour in there.



•  Establishing baseline activities of daily living (ADL) in the home is crucial to assist people in need of care, identify onset of conditions, and engage with them in behaviour change.



•  Technology is an enabler, but its history inside the home is mixed – at best!
Challenges


1.   Technology : no real shortage …, but ….
•     Neither as reliable nor as autonomous as needed/expected
•     Not context-aware   too intrusive/not intrusive enough?
•     Too heterogeneous (not interoperable)
•     Still not as efficient as needed

2.   It is not about technology or data;
It is what do we learn from the data, and how we use
this knowledge.

3.   Privacy, trust and user acceptance
•      Increase trust through the application of the technology the right way

4.   Need for truly multidisciplinary approaches
•     Terminology, practices, vision and understanding differences are still
                     very large

Next steps
•   Answering emerging clinical questions from the Medical Faculties (e.g. Social and Community Medicine) and industry/NHS via a pre-proposal proof-of- concept requires data.
•   This has all been done in lab environments already –  the interesting questions are what we observe at home.






SPHERE has acquired a small house in
central Bristol.


This will lead us towards full-scale
deployments.

Summary:
• SPHERE has built an Internet of Things platform that provides comprehensive
activities   for   healthcare   and   wellbeing   monitoring   in   real-life   home
environments
• SPHERE will advance the state of the art in:
• ultra low power communications
• on-body energy harvesting
• video analytics in unconstrained environments
• extraction of meaning from complex uncertain data sets.
• the understanding of user/technology interaction in the home for healthcare.
• SPHERE’s team connects:
• clinical need to engineers and computer scientists
• emerging clinical research to evolving new technology.

• SPHERE is looking for collaborators to work together to address
these challenges.
