//IoT transforming Medical Devices

How the Internet of Things Is Transforming Medical Devices?

-by digitization & medical devices=
medical devices are transforming themselves from devices/consumables providers to disease/care management organizations.
digitization in acute care, chronic care or in adherence is greatly aided by IoT-powered medical devices such as subtaneous drug delivery units, continuos glucose monitors and vitals monitoring equipment

medical tech range from implantable devices, capital-intensive diagnostic and monitoring equipment, to mobile medical apps

- by Community of practice= establishing a collaboration-oriented community of practice (CoP) for IoT
this function provide strategic direction, set governance and ensure broader alignment with enterprise goals

- by cultivate partner ecosystem= by cultivating partner ecosystem, medical devices companies can benefit by mitigating concerns around regulatory requirements, accelerating time-to-market and reducing technology risks.

-by looking forward= we foresee that the digital divide between industrial IoT and consumer IoT will start to dissolve, giving rise to new bussiness possibilities.
medical devices are likely to have built-in user preferences to control how personal data is communicated and shared

 We expect, in the next few years, user-controlled connected medical devices to become ubiquitous. The progression of the IoT is set to unleash new frontiers in customer-centricity with unprecedented levels of digitization in the medical devices industry.

IoT---------------------> Medical devices
apa itu IoT ? things di IoT= device yg bisa connect ke internet-- harus bisa ngasih data
MD= tdnya cuma di store di device aja, tp skg udh kehubung ke internet (bisa bentuk cloud, portable, embbeded devce, dll) -- tdnya storage ada di device rumah sakit

big data= supaya bisa di analisis, tujuannya= decision making bisa untuk marketing

# IoT in Healthcare
ga cuma di sensor aja tapi juga sekarang ada di device
(stakeholder in HC): payers, patient, caregivers, med devices, pharmaneurical companies

(-) kurangnya standard, crowded (kebanyakan sensor)-- banyak pabrik yang mau ngehasilin produk, relative nascent stage of tech (kyk ada bbrp versi cth usb 1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
